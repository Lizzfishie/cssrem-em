/* rem is relevant to the html font-size. The declaration of the font-size in the .box class has no effect on the p element. By default the html font-size is 16px. 0.1 rem means display as 1.6px as long as the font-size isn't set to another value (or the browsersettings are changed). A font-size of 2rem means that the font-size is 32px. In this case 0.1 rem means display as 3.2px */
